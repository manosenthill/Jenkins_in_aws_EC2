#### Configure Jenkins
Jenkins is now installed and running on our EC2 instance. To configure Jenkins:

Connect to `http://<your_server_public_DNS>:8080` from your favorite browser.
You will be able to access Jenkins through its management interface:
![onlock jenkins](./images/jenkins/unlock.png)

- As prompted, enter the password found in `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`

Use the following command to display this password:
